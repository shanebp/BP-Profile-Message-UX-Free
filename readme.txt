This plugin replaces the functionality for the Public Message and Private Message buttons on profile pages.

== Description == 
BP Profile Message UX is a BuddyPress plugin. 

Default behavior for the buttons is to take you to your own profile - to compose and send messages from there. 
Why ? 
Why not stay on the profile page you are viewing ?

Fortunately, BuddyPress makes it easy to replace the functionality for those buttons. 
With this plugin you can stay on a profile page and send messages. 
It uses the 'thickbox' code built into WordPress. 
It uses the default styling - so it's not pretty but you can style it any way you want.
